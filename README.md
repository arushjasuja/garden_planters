*A Strategic Game for Young Gardeners*

# The Magic of the Garden

On a sunny Saturday morning, twins Maya and Leo discover an old iron
gate hidden behind their grandmother\'s house. Curious, they push it
open and step into an amazing secret: an enormous garden, wild and
abandoned, with overgrown paths winding between empty flower beds.

As they walk deeper into the garden, they notice four tall statues
standing at the corners - ancient gardeners carved from stone, covered
in moss and vines. When Maya reaches out to touch one, something
incredible happens: the statues\' eyes begin to glow with a soft golden
light!

\"Welcome, young gardeners,\" the statues say in unison, their voices
like wind through leaves. \"We have been waiting for someone with the
spark of creativity and the wisdom of strategy. Long ago, this garden
was alive with colour and magic, attracting butterflies from all across
the land. But the magic has faded, and the butterflies have gone.\"

The tallest statue, wearing a crown of flowers, continues: \"The
garden\'s magic can only be awakened through thoughtful design and
clever planning. You must work together - or against each other - to
create the most beautiful and strategic layout. Whoever designs with
both heart and mind will bring the butterflies back to your town!\"

Maya and Leo look at each other with excitement. The garden statues have
handed them a special challenge: become master planners and restore the
garden\'s ancient magic!

# What\'s Garden Planters?

Garden Planters is a two-player strategy board game where you and a
friend (or sibling, or parent!) become gardeners designing a beautiful
community garden. The game is all about smart planning, creative
thinking, and out-manoeuvring your opponent - but in a peaceful,
garden-themed way!

**Think of it like chess meets gardening:** your pieces move across the
board planting flowers, and the goal is to position them so cleverly
that your opponent can\'t move anymore!

# Three Ways to Play

Garden Planters offers three difficulty levels, so you can choose how
complex you want the game to be:

## 🌱 Beginner Level {#beginner-level}

*Perfect for first-time players!*

- Uses only Sunflowers (15 per player) and Rose Bushes (10 per player)

- Great for learning the basic strategy

## 🌼 Standard Level {#standard-level}

*The complete classic experience!*

# Setup (All Levels)

Set up the board with each player\'s four gardeners in these starting
positions (rows and columns are numbered 0-9):

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Player 1</strong></th>
<th><strong>Player 2</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Position 1: (0, 3)</p>
<p>Position 2: (3, 0)</p>
<p>Position 3: (6, 0)</p>

<p>Position 2: (3, 9)</p>
<p>Position 3: (6, 9)</p>
<p>Position 4: (9, 6)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Tip: (row, column) means the first number is how far down from the top,
and the second number is how far across from the left!*

# How Gardeners Move

**Your gardeners move like queens in chess - they can travel any
distance in a straight line:**

- Horizontally (left or right)

- Vertically (up or down)

- Diagonally (in any diagonal direction)

**Important:** Gardeners cannot jump over or land on other gardeners or
flowers! They must move to an empty square.

# 🌱 Beginner Level Rules {#beginner-level-rules}

## Your Turn (3 Simple Steps)

4.  **MOVE:** Choose one of your gardeners and move it to any empty
    square in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

5.  **PLANT:** Place ONE flower on the square your gardener just moved
    FROM.

6.  **END:** Your turn is over! Now it\'s your opponent\'s turn.

That\'s it! The game continues with players taking turns until someone
can\'t move any of their gardeners.

## Flower Types (Beginner)

**🌻 Sunflower (×30 total):**

- Use strategically to block off large areas

# 🌺 Advanced Level Rules {#advanced-level-rules}

Advanced level includes all Standard level rules PLUS seasonal mechanics
and special garden features!

## The Four Seasons

The garden changes through the seasons! Count the turns and apply these
special rules:

**🌱 Spring (Turns 1-8): Normal Play**

Everything works exactly like Standard level. Place your flower on the
square your gardener just moved from (or adjacent for Wildflowers).
It\'s planting season - get your garden started!

**☀️ Summer (Turns 9-16): Sunflowers Bloom!**

Sunflowers grow bigger in the summer heat! Each Sunflower now blocks its
own square PLUS the 4 squares directly adjacent (up, down, left, right).
This makes the board fill up faster!

**🍂 Autumn (Turns 17-24): Long-Range Planting**

The cool weather gives you more planting options! You can place your
flower on the square you moved FROM, OR on any square adjacent to where
your gardener moved TO (your choice of up to 9 total squares). This adds
a new strategic challenge!

**❄️ Winter (Turn 25+): Rose Bush Jumping**

In the quiet winter, gardeners can carefully navigate thorny bushes.
Once per turn, your gardener can jump over a Rose Bush (but not land on
it). This can create surprise escape routes!

## Garden Features

Each player can use each feature once per game:

**⛲ Fountain:**

Once per game, instead of your normal move, teleport one of your
gardeners to any square within 2 spaces of the center (5,5).

**🗑️ Compost Bin:**

Once per game, declare that you\'re using the Compost Bin. Your next 2
flowers can be ANY type (even if you\'ve run out of that type).

**🧹 Scarecrow:**

Once per game, after you plant your flower, activate the Scarecrow. Your
opponent must place their next flower at least 3 squares away from ALL
their gardeners. Tricky!

## Winning & Scoring (Advanced) {#winning-scoring-advanced}

Same as Standard level - includes all four flower types and Rainbow
Garden bonus!

# Example Game: First 5 Turns

Let\'s watch Maya (Player 1) and Leo (Player 2) play the first few turns
in Standard level to see how the game works!

### Turn 1 - Maya\'s Move

- Maya moves her gardener from (0,3) to (2,3) - moving 2 squares down

- She plants a Sunflower at (0,3) - the square she just moved from

*Strategy: Maya plants where she was standing, beginning to block the
top area!*

### Turn 2 - Leo\'s Move

- Leo moves his gardener from (0,6) to (2,6) - also moving down

- He plants a Rose Bush at (0,6) - the square he just moved from

*Strategy: Smart! The Rose Bush at (0,6) blocks that square PLUS the 4
diagonal squares around it!*

### Turn 3 - Maya\'s Move

- Maya moves her gardener from (3,0) to (3,2) - moving 2 squares right

- She plants a Sunflower at (3,0) - the square she just moved from

*Strategy: Blocking the left edge of the board.*

### Turn 4 - Leo\'s Move

- Leo moves his gardener from (3,9) diagonally to (5,7)

- He plants a Lily Pond at (3,9) - the square he just moved from

*Strategy: Leo blocks the right edge and earns a Lily Pond for bonus
points!*

### Turn 5 - Maya\'s Move

- Maya moves her gardener from (6,0) to (6,3)

- She plants a Wildflower at (6,0) - the square she just moved from

*Strategy: Maya is blocking the left edge further down!*

The game continues like this, with each player trying to position their
gardeners cleverly while blocking their opponent\'s moves. The tension
builds as the board fills up with flowers!

# Strategy Tips for Beginners

**1. Control the Centre**

The middle squares (around (5,5)) give your gardeners the most options
for future moves. Try to claim this area early!

**2. Use Rose Bushes Wisely**

Rose Bushes are powerful because they block 5 squares total! Save them
for important moments when you want to cut off a large section of the
board or trap an opponent\'s gardener.

**3. Keep Your Gardeners Spread Out**

If all your gardeners cluster together, you\'ll run out of moves
quickly! Try to keep them in different areas of the board so you always
have options.

**4. Think Two Moves Ahead**

Before you move, ask yourself: \'Where can my opponent move next?\' and
\'Will my gardener have anywhere to go on my next turn?\' Planning ahead
helps you avoid getting stuck!

**5. Watch for Trap Opportunities**

Sometimes you can surround one of your opponent\'s gardeners with
flowers, cutting off all their escape routes. This is like capturing a
piece in chess!

**6. Use Wildflowers Strategically (Standard/Advanced)**

Wildflowers\' flexible placement makes them perfect for blocking
unexpected squares or creating emergency defensive positions!

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I move a gardener zero squares (stay in place)?**

A: No! You must move to a different square if you have any legal moves
available. If none of your gardeners can move to a different square, you
lose.

**Q: Can I plant a flower right next to a gardener?**

A: You can plant a flower on any EMPTY square, even right next to
gardeners. But you cannot plant a flower on a square that has a gardener
or another flower on it.

**Q: What if I run out of one type of flower?**

A: If you\'re out of a flower type, you can\'t place it anymore - choose
a different type! This is why it\'s important to manage your flowers
wisely. (Exception: Advanced level Compost Bin feature lets you place
any type!)

**Q: Can a Rose Bush block another Rose Bush?**

A: Yes! Once a Rose Bush is placed, it blocks its square and the 4
diagonal squares. Other flowers can still be placed on the board (in
non-blocked squares), but those blocked squares become off-limits for
gardeners to move through.

**Q: In Advanced mode, when does each season start?**

A: Spring = Turns 1-8, Summer = Turns 9-16, Autumn = Turns 17-24, Winter
= Turn 25 onwards. Track your turn count!

**Q: What if both players still have moves but we want to end the
game?**

A: You can agree to end the game and use the scoring system - whoever
has more points wins!
